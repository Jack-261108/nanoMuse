//  NanoMuseChatModifiers.swift
//  nanoMuse
//
//  Why these exist. `AIChatView.body` is one expression of some sixty chained
//  modifiers (sheets, alerts, listeners). Each link wraps the value so far in
//  another `ModifiedContent`: the body's value grows with every link, the
//  compiler holds the intermediate copies on the stack while the getter builds
//  the chain, and the Swift runtime — asked for the metadata of the finished
//  type the first time the body runs — recurses once per level of nesting.
//  0.1.38 added four links of ours (the composer's fail-safe host, the C9
//  presence hooks) and build 9 overflowed the main thread's stack on an iPad
//  the moment the chat appeared after onboarding, every launch: SIGSEGV in the
//  stack guard, `AIChatView.body.getter` →
//  `__swift_instantiateConcreteTypeFromMangledNameV2` →
//  `swift::Demangle::TypeDecoder::decodeMangledType` (Minis-2026-10-06-005159.ips,
//  symbolised with the dSYM of TestFlight run 9).
//
//  The cure: our links are grouped here into two modifiers, so the chain is
//  as long as 0.1.37's again, and the composer column and the popup layer are
//  boxed in `AnyView`s, so the body's value carries one pointer for the
//  largest subtrees instead of the subtrees themselves. New chat-wide
//  behaviour goes into these modifiers (or a third one), never as another
//  link on `AIChatView.body`; `NanoMuseRound6Tests.testChatBodyStaysSmallAndShallow`
//  keeps the depth in check.

/// (`NmChatBottomLayout`, #331). The list keeps its content clear of the column with a bottom
/// inset of the column's measured height plus the bar (`columnHeight` is written here and read
/// by the chat for the list and for the scroll buttons). The `/` and `@` popup and its

/// 0.1.40 to 1.0.3 had the column as a `VStack` row under a shorter list (the composer that could
/// not be seen in 0.1.36 to 0.1.39 was a safe-area inset on the NavigationStack's ancestor, fixed
/// in `NanoMuseHomeView.body`; the row was the simplest layout that could not fail). That
